# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a custom lightweight telemetry protocol designed for constrained IoT sensors. The protocol enables periodic transmission of small sensor readings (temperature, humidity, voltage) to a central collector over UDP. The system must be cross-platform (Linux/Windows), loss-tolerant, and experimentally validated under various network conditions using network impairment simulation.

## Glossary

- **TelemetrySystem**: The complete IoT telemetry system including sensor clients and collector server
- **SensorClient**: The client application that simulates IoT sensors and sends telemetry data
- **CollectorServer**: The server application that receives, processes, and logs telemetry data
- **DataPacket**: A UDP packet containing one or more sensor readings with protocol header
- **HeartbeatPacket**: A UDP packet indicating device liveness when no new data is available
- **SequenceNumber**: A monotonically increasing counter per device to detect loss and duplicates
- **BatchingMode**: Optional mode where multiple sensor readings are grouped into a single packet
- **NetworkImpairment**: Simulated network conditions (loss, delay, jitter) using Linux netem or Windows Clumsy

## Requirements
