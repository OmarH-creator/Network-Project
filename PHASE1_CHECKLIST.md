- [ ] **Demo video link added:** PLACEHOLDER - needs your actual link
- [ ] **Video link tested:** Verify it works in incognito/private browser

**Action:** 
1. Record your demo video (use `docs/demo-video-script.md` as guide)
2. Upload to YouTube (unlisted) or Google Drive
3. Replace `[INSERT YOUR VIDEO LINK HERE]` in README.md with actual link
4. Test the link in a private/incognito browser window

---

### 5. Demo Video (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Video recorded:** 5-minute demonstration
- [ ] **Content covers:**
  - [ ] Protocol overview and message format
  - [ ] Live server startup
  - [ ] Client sending DATA packets
  - [ ] Multiple concurrent clients (optional but impressive)
  - [ ] CSV logs generated
  - [ ] Automated baseline test running
- [ ] **Uploaded online:** YouTube, Google Drive, or similar
- [ ] **Access set correctly:** "Anyone with the link can view"
- [ ] **Link added to README:** In the Demo Video section
- [ ] **Link tested:** Works in incognito browser

**Action:** Follow the script in `docs/demo-video-script.md` to record your video.

**Suggested platforms:**
- **YouTube:** Upload as "Unlisted" video
- **Google Drive:** Upload and set sharing to "Anyone with the link"
- **OneDrive:** Similar sharing settings
- **Vimeo:** Free account with privacy settings

---

### 6. Automated Baseline Test Script

- [x] **Script exists:** `scripts/test_baseline.py`
- [x] **Runs automatically:** No manual intervention needed
- [x] **Starts server:** Automatically launches collector
- [x] **Starts client:** Automatically launches sensor
- [x] **Generates logs:** CSV file created in `output/`
- [x] **Calculates metrics:** Performance metrics computed
- [x] **Validation included:** Checks for ‚â•99% delivery and sequence order
- [x] **Works on your platform:** Tested on Windows

**Action:** Run one final test to verify:
```bash
python scripts/test_baseline.py --duration 30
```

Expected output:
- Server starts
- Client runs for 30 seconds
- Test completes with [PASS] indicators
- Files created: `output/baseline_telemetry.csv` and `output/baseline_metrics.json`

## üìù Quick Start for Final Verification

Run these commands in sequence to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Clean previous outputs
rm output/*.csv output/*.json

# 2. Run automated baseline test
python scripts/test_baseline.py --duration 30

# 3. Verify output files exist
ls output/

# 4. Check CSV log has data
head output/baseline_telemetry.csv

# 5. Check metrics JSON
cat output/baseline_metrics.json
```

If all commands succeed, your prototype is ready!
