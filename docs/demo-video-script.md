# TinyTelemetry v1.0 - Demo Video Script (5 minutes)

This script provides a structured outline for recording your 5-minute demo video.

---

## Setup Before Recording

1. Open 3 terminal windows side-by-side
2. Have the project directory open in your file explorer
3. Clear any previous output files: `rm output/*.csv output/*.json` (or delete manually)
4. Test your screen recording software
5. Ensure audio is clear

## Script Timeline

### **[0:00 - 0:30] Introduction (30 seconds)**

**[Show title slide or project README]**

> "Hello! I'm presenting TinyTelemetry v1.0, a lightweight UDP-based protocol designed for IoT sensor telemetry. This protocol enables resource-constrained sensors to efficiently transmit temperature, humidity, and voltage readings to a central collector."

**[Show project structure in file explorer]**

> "The project consists of a sensor client, collector server, and protocol library, all implemented in Python. Let me show you how it works."

---

### **[0:30 - 1:30] Protocol Overview (1 minute)**

**[Open docs/mini-rfc.md and scroll to header format]**

> "TinyTelemetry uses a compact 12-byte binary header containing version, message type, device ID, sequence number, and timestamp. This is much more efficient than JSON-based protocols."

**[Show the header table]**

> "Each DATA message can carry one or more sensor readings. Each reading is just 5 bytes: 1 byte for sensor type and 4 bytes for the float value. This compact encoding reduces bandwidth by 4 to 16 times compared to JSON."

**[Show sample message hex dump]**

> "Here's an example: this 18-byte packet contains a complete telemetry message with one temperature reading of 25 degrees Celsius."

---

### **[1:30 - 3:00] Live Demo (1.5 minutes)**

**[Terminal 1: Start the server]**

> "Let me demonstrate the system. First, I'll start the collector server on port 5000."

```bash
python -m src.server --port 5000 --log-file output/demo_telemetry.csv
```

**[Wait for server to start, show output]**

> "The server is now listening for UDP packets and will log all received data to a CSV file."

**[Terminal 2: Start first client]**

> "Now I'll start a sensor client with device ID 1001, sending data every second for 30 seconds."

```bash
python -m src.client --device-id 1001 --server-host localhost --server-port 5000 --interval 1 --duration 30
```

**[Show client output - sequence numbers incrementing]**

> "You can see the client is generating sensor readings and transmitting DATA packets. Each packet has an incrementing sequence number."

**[Terminal 3: Start second client while first is running]**

> "The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously. Let me start a second sensor with device ID 1002."

```bash
python -m src.client --device-id 1002 --server-host localhost --server-port 5000 --interval 1 --duration 20
```

**[Show both clients running, server receiving from both]**

> "Now we have two sensors transmitting concurrently. The server is receiving and logging data from both devices."

**[Wait for clients to finish, show completion messages]**

> "Both clients have completed their transmissions. Let me stop the server."

**[Press Ctrl+C in Terminal 1 to stop server]**

---

### **[3:00 - 4:00] Results and Logs (1 minute)**

**[Open output/demo_telemetry.csv in a text editor or Excel]**

> "Here's the CSV log file generated by the server. Each row represents a received packet with metadata."

**[Scroll through the CSV, point out key columns]**

> "We can see device IDs, sequence numbers, timestamps, message types, and importantly - the duplicate flag and gap flag. These show the server's duplicate detection and gap detection working."

**[Show a few rows]**

> "Notice device 1001 and 1002 are interleaved. The server correctly handles concurrent clients and maintains separate state for each device."

**[Open output directory in file explorer]**

> "The system also generates JSON metrics files for performance analysis."

---

### **[4:00 - 4:45] Automated Testing (45 seconds)**

**[Terminal: Run baseline test]**

> "The project includes automated testing. Let me run the baseline test script."

```bash
python scripts/test_baseline.py --duration 15
```

**[Show test running - progress indicators]**

> "This script automatically starts the server, runs a client, collects data, and calculates performance metrics."

**[Show test completion with PASS indicators]**

> "The test passed! It verified that we achieved greater than 99% packet delivery and all sequence numbers were in order."

**[Show the generated metrics JSON file briefly]**

> "The test generates detailed metrics including bytes per report, packet counts, duplicate rate, and sequence gaps."

---

### **[4:45 - 5:00] Conclusion (15 seconds)**

**[Show README.md or project structure]**

> "TinyTelemetry demonstrates that a purpose-built protocol can be much more efficient than general-purpose alternatives for IoT telemetry. The complete source code, documentation, and test scripts are available in the repository. Thank you!"

**[End recording]**

## Recording Tips

1. **Practice first**: Run through the script 2-3 times before recording
2. **Keep it moving**: Don't pause too long on any screen
3. **Clear audio**: Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
4. **Show, don't just tell**: Actually run the commands and show real output
5. **Time management**: If running over, cut the protocol overview section shorter
6. **Backup plan**: If something fails during recording, have pre-generated output files ready

## After Recording

1. Upload to YouTube (unlisted) or Google Drive
2. Set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view"
3. Test the link in an incognito browser window
4. Add the link to your README.md
