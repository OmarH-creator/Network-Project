**YOU NEED TO:**
1. Record 5-minute demo using the script in `docs/demo-video-script.md`
2. Upload to YouTube (unlisted) or Google Drive
3. Set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view"
4. Replace `[INSERT YOUR VIDEO LINK HERE]` in `README.md` with actual link
5. Also update `README.txt` with the same link
6. Test the link in incognito/private browser

**Demo Should Cover:**
- Protocol overview (30 seconds)
- Message format explanation (1 minute)
- Live server and client demo (1.5 minutes)
- CSV logs and duplicate/gap detection (1 minute)
- Automated baseline test (45 seconds)

### 6. ‚úÖ Automated Baseline Test Script
**File:** `scripts/test_baseline.py`

Features:
- Automatically starts server and client
- Runs for configurable duration (default 60s)
- Generates CSV logs and JSON metrics
- Validates ‚â•99% delivery rate
- Checks sequence order
- Reports PASS/FAIL status

**Test Command:**
```bash
python scripts/test_baseline.py --duration 30
```

## üöÄ Quick Final Test

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Clean previous outputs
rm output/*.csv output/*.json

# 2. Run automated baseline test
python scripts/test_baseline.py --duration 30

# 3. Verify output files exist
ls output/
